muhap_pipeline
==============

Introduction
------------

This pipeline contains a wrapper for vivaxGEN NGS-Pipeline, a SNP-based variant
calling pipeline, which has been setup to process P vivax sequence data.
This pipeline will produce ordinary VCF file that can be used for further
downstream analysis.

Currently, this pipeline was setup to use multi-step mode of vivaxGEN
NGS-Pipeline in a single command line with GATK-based workflow to generate VCF
file
There is also Freebayes-based workflow, but it requires modification of the
setting, which will not be covered in this documentation.

Quick Tutorial
--------------

The following instructions show how to run this pipeline.
It is assumed that the pipeline has been installed.

1.  Activate the environment. The terminal will show ``(µhaps)`` prompt.

2.  Go to the directory that will be used to process and analysis::

		cd MY_ANALYSIS_DIRECTORY

3.  Provide the FASTQ reads from the sequencing result, by either copying the
    FASTQ files or alternatively generate soft link as necessary.
    The soft link approach is preferred since it will prevent duplication of
    the files, if the files are already reside in the local storage.
    The FASTQ files should be in fastq.gz format (gzip-compressed), and the
    filenames should reflect the sample name, eg: my-sample-01_R1.fastq.gz.
    If the FASTQ filenames contains something that are not part of the sample
    names, there is an option ``--underscore`` in the next step that can be
    used::

    	mkdir reads
    	cp SOME_WHERE/*.fastq.gz

    or link the whole directory:

    	ln -s SOME_SOURCE_DIR reads

    or link individual files:

      ln -s SOME_DIR/SAMPLE_R1.fastq.gz reads
      ln -s SOME_DIR/SAMPLE_R2.fastq.gz reads
      ...

    or link individual file using for-loop in bash:

      for fn in SOME_DIR/SAMPLE*.fastq.gz; do ln -s $fn reads; done

    or use the commmand ``generate-link`` as follows:

      ngs-pl generate-links -o reads SOME_SOURCE_DIR/*.fastq.gz

4.  Execute the ``run-discovery-variant-caller`` command with as follow::

		ngs-pl run-discovery-variant-caller -o MY_OUTPUT reads/*.fastq.gz

5. When the command finishes, examine the content of ``MY_OUTPUT`` directory::

		cd MY_OUTPUT
		ls

The following is the layout of the output directory::

    MY_OUTPUT/
              metafile/
                       manifest.tsv
              analysis/
                       SAMPLE-1/
                       SAMPLE-2/
                       ...
              joint/
                    vcfs/
              reports/
                      depth-base/
                      maps/
              failed_samples/
                             SAMPLE-8/
                             SAMPLE-9/
                             ...
